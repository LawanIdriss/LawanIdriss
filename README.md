Founder & CEO, Seamium  
**Autonomous by Design**

Hello. I’m Lawan Idriss, founder and CEO of Seamium. I work at the intersection of energy systems and large-scale compute, building technology that governs how energy is used under real-world constraints.

My focus is on engineered autonomy. Systems that adapt to changing conditions, reduce operational burden, and remain dependable over time. The goal is practical reliability, efficiency, and long-term resilience in environments where energy matters.


## About Seamium

Seamium builds autonomous energy systems for modern compute infrastructure. The company develops an engine that governs how AI workloads and supporting systems consume energy, based on real availability, cost, and operating limits.

Rather than treating energy as a fixed input or downstream concern, Seamium makes it a first-class control signal within infrastructure operations.



## What the engine does

- Observes energy and system conditions in real time  
- Governs workload behavior in response to availability, cost, and constraints  
- Adapts continuously instead of relying on static rules  
- Detects faults early and maintains stability over time  
- Operates securely with minimal human intervention  


## Why it matters

Energy is no longer an abstract utility. It shapes cost, reliability, and the ability to scale compute systems. Seamium replaces manual coordination and rigid controls with autonomous behavior, allowing infrastructure to remain efficient, accountable, and resilient as conditions change.
